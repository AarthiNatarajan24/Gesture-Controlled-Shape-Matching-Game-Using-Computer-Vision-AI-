# Gesture-Controlled-Shape-Matching-Game-Using-Computer-Vision-AI-
A gesture-based shape matching game using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. Users drag and place shapes like circle, square, rectangle, and triangle using pinch gestures detected by webcam. When matched correctly to targets, shapes snap into place with a sound. A fun and interactive way to explore hand tracking.
